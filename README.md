## Inspiration, Purpose and Goals
This project was inspired by a professor's desire to ride around the University of Toronto campus inside and outside buildings on a robot that could wave to students with mechanical arms.

After scaling down the scope of the project to fit within a provided budget of $1000, the primary objective of this project was to build a robot that would complement another research project that involved the use of artificial intelligence for facial and voice recognition on a computer. With this in mind, the robot was designed with a laptop mount, but to further ability to interact with humans, it was also given the capability to navigate through conventional doorways inside buildings of the university campus and to mechanically interact with humans through pre-programmed robotic arm gestures. 

As a secondary objective during construction, the approach of pushing the limits of the quality of the final product with as minimal expense as possible was taken.

## What It Does / Overview
MrGrabs is a medium-sized (16x16x20'') robot, capable of driving through doors with at lest 2' of clearance. It is built primarily out of PLA, with plexiglass and wood used to reinforce the chassis. The robot is controlled via a custom bluetooth APP on an Andriod phone, and integrated with a Microsoft Surface Pro running an application of another project to scan for, greet and wave to students on campus. It also has four HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors that are unused but intended to be a safety feature to prevent collisions.
